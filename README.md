Arch Linux stuff: 
I wanted to speed up common commands i use in terminal/console in linux, one way is to use Alias for commands, i decided the function keys are available so one can use them to carry out your favourite commands instead of having to type them in, I show a few as an example you can add your own in place, and update your .bashrc file. 
To check which keys correspond to which escape sequence use this web page to lookup code : http://aperiodic.net/phil/archives/Geekery/term-function-keys.html or just use google.
They will work for all GNU/Linux terminals
Tip: i have added myself as not requiring password so commands work instantly. F9 for screenfetch and F12 to run pacman -Syu
